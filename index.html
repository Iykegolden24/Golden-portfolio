                            Afrobeat drumming to the world was a concept i created by showcasing afro drumeming, playing
                            different drum covers and uploading it on Youtube so the world can feel what afrobeat
                            drumming sounds like and embrace the culture of african music. Today afrobeat drumming is
                            global!!!
